# cover.sh: the test audit's line map for one main sha (#mp71kkr, @system_adamic_tests): the whole Go suite, planned as
# the star's gate plans it, with every part also writing which lines of Adamic's own Go packages its tests executed
# (ADAMIC_GATE_COVERPKG, read by the unit body). replay.sh then sends a mutant only to the parts that ran its line,
# since a compiler mutant reaches about 44 packages by imports and most of them never execute the changed line.
#
#	pilots/adamic-gate/cover.sh <sha> [<units>]    # plans the job and prints its path; Loom runs it on the star's pool
#
# The map covers Go only: the C runtime and the stage1 ports' .a and .ts sources aren't Go coverage's to see, and a
# mutant there replays on its own package by name (REPLAY_PACKAGES). Coverage slows tests, so the units get the gate's
# budget doubled; a part that times out under coverage leaves its lines unmapped, and the map says which.
